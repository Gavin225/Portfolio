			This was a photo taken from the early shooting of one of my video projects. I was testing the lighting and wanted to see how the object would reflect lighting off its surface. There are some noticable reflections but I don't think they were too jarring.</p>

			This was a photo I took at my grandparent's lakehouse in early March of 2022. Over the coming days I'd look outside to see how the ice would change, and this was from day one. Some day's it would almost reform, others it would be nearly gone. Sometime's it would be so solid you could (probably) walk on it </p>

			title="Bald Eagle outside the Lakehouse March 2023"
			width="550"
			height="auto"
			align="left" />
			This was a photo I took at the lakehouse the same month a year later. I thought that a large branch was hanging on the side of the tree, but upon closer inspection I realized it was a large bird. When I got the large zoom lens for my camera and went to shoot the picture only then did I realize it was a bald eagle. I only wish it had turned it's head for a moment for that full headshot </p>

			alt="Sunset over Massacheusetts July 2018"
			title="Photo of lake champlain ice cracking"

			This was a photo I took during a family vacation to Massacheusetts in the summer of 2018. Every night the sun would set over this horizon along the beach, and I wanted to get a good photo of it every time. In retrospect I should've just taken one photo, then one video of the sunset, but atleast it was good practice for some landscape photography as some photos would come out blurry,which was not the case with this one.</p>
